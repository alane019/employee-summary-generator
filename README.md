# Employee Summary Generator

Demo is viewable here: [https://alane019.github.io/employee-summary-generator/](https://alane019.github.io/employee-summary-generator/)

This is a Node.js terminal application which allows a user to dynamically generate an html page that presents an informational summary of employees on a software development team. Utilizing the Inquirer package to drive the terminal prompt interface, the application will present certain questions throughout the prompt, depending on the type of employee (engineer, manager, intern), and display role-specific icons in the output html, based on these employee data responses.
